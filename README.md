# stock_view_backend
A side project to learn about the stock market and the basics of machine learning with Django Python. There's nothing here now but there will be soon. 

For more information on the planning phases of this project checkout my blog posts here(the development of this backend project starts on Phase 2):

 * Phase 0: https://alecthedeveloper.wordpress.com/2019/03/25/a-d3-mechine-learning-and-django-project-phase-0/. 
 * Phase 1: https://alecthedeveloper.wordpress.com/2019/04/15/a-d3-mechine-learning-and-django-project-phase-1/.
 * Phase 2: https://alecthedeveloper.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/a-d3-mechine-learning-and-django-project-phase-2-and-other-new-developments/


Currently the code in this repo has little to do with the project other then the fact that it's Django server code and some of the file names have the name StockView on them. Currently I'm taking an online course on Django and pushing my progress here. Eventually when I finish the course I will scrap this code and start over to produce the API I orrigonally intended for this repo to hold. When that happens I will post the appropiate setup instruction for the api here. Stay tuned!
